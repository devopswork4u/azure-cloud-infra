## Azure Cloud Core Concepts
Azure is Microsoft‚Äôs cloud computing platform offering Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), Also CaaS (Container as Service). It provides scalable, pay-as-you-
go solutions for computing, storage, networking, databases, machine learning, analytics, and
many more.

# Traditional On-Premises vs. Cloud Computing: Key Differences

### 1. Infrastructure Ownership
  * On-Premises: Organizations own, manage, and maintain all hardware and software on-site. This includes physical servers, networking equipment, and data centers.
  * Cloud Computing (e.g., Microsoft Azure): Infrastructure is hosted and managed by a cloud provider. Users access resources over the internet on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.

### 2. Scalability
  * On-Premises: Scaling requires purchasing and installing new hardware, which is time-consuming and expensive. Overprovisioning is common to meet future demand.
  * Azure Cloud: Instantly scale resources up or down based on demand. Whether running a small test application or a global enterprise system, Azure provides automatic and elastic scalability without overinvesting.

### 3. Global Reach
  * On-Premises: Geographic expansion means setting up new data centers in different locations, which is costly and complex.
  * Azure Cloud: Azure has a vast global network of data centers in over 60 regions worldwide. Applications can be deployed closer to users, improving performance and meeting data residency requirements.

### 4. Cost-Efficiency
  * On-Premises: High upfront **capital expenditure** for servers, facilities, and IT staff. Costs are often fixed regardless of usage.
  * Azure Cloud: Operates on a pay-as-you-go or subscription-based model, converting CapEx to operational expenditure (OpEx). You pay only for what you use, reducing waste and increasing financial flexibility.

## Summary of Azure Advantages:
  * Scalability: Rapid, on-demand scaling without hardware limitations.
  * Global Reach: Presence in data centers worldwide for high availability and low latency.
  * Cost-Efficiency: Lower upfront costs, pay-as-you-go pricing, and better resource utilization.

## Azure Hosting Models
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
  Provides virtual machines, storage, and networking. Users have full control over the operating system, applications, and configurations.

* Platform as a Service (PaaS):
  Offers a ready-to-use platform to develop, test, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
  examples : Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, logic App, WebApp, AKS, Keyvault

* Software as a Service (SaaS):
  Delivers fully managed software applications over the internet. Users simply access and use the software without managing any infrastructure or platform components.
  examples:  Office 365, Azure DevOps

## Azure Services
* Compute: Virtual Machines, App Services, Azure Kubernetes Service.
* Storage: Blob, Table, Queue, File Storage.
* Networking: VNet, Load Balancer, ExpressRoute.
* AI & Machine Learning, DevOps, Security.

## Subscribing to Microsoft Azure [How do I start using Azure Services]
  ### What You Need First:
    * A Microsoft account (e.g., Outlook, Hotmail, or any email registered with Microsoft)
    * A valid credit/debit card (for identity verification)
    * A phone number (for security/identity verification)
